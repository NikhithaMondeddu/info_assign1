The scoring system helps a cybersecurity analyst quickly identify the most dangerous attack techniques by assigning higher scores to threats linked to credential theft, privilege escalation, remote access, and security bypass behaviors. Instead of manually reviewing hundreds of techniques, analysts can focus first on those with the highest scores. This reduces investigation time and ensures that high-impact threats are addressed before lower-risk ones. The logic-based scoring also makes the prioritization transparent and easy to justify in a security operations environment.
